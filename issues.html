                <br>CAUSES:-<br>
                1. Expansion ,Infrastructure and Mining.<br>

                <h1>POLLUTION</h1>
                <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.<br>
               <br> TYPES:-<br>
                air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.
                 <br><br>FACTS:-<br>
                 1. Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year.
                 <br>2. Pollution is one of the biggest global killers, affecting over 100 million people. Thatâ€™s comparable to global diseases like malaria and HIV.

                    <p>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat.<br>
                    <br>FACTS:-<br>
                    1. Only 9% of all plastic produced is recycled.
